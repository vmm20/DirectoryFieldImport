# G Suite Directory Field Import
This Google Sheets addon can import directory information from the G Suite global address list in your domain based on email addresses in your spreadsheet.  Create columns for first name, last name, full name, title, or department.

The JavaScript files are intended to run with Google Apps Script.  When using these files, change the extensions to .gs from .js, or use the [clasp](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/clasp) tool to upload them, which will change the extensions automatically.

The CSS and client-side JS files must have the HTML extension to work properly.  They are imported into the main HTML file using scriptlets.
